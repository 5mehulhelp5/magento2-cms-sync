# Development Workflow Enhancement Guide

This document outlines the custom subagents and slash commands created to enhance the development workflow for the Magento CMS Sync project.

## Overview

The project now includes:
- **6 Specialized Subagents** for automated code review, testing, debugging, and PR review
- **16 Custom Slash Commands** for common development tasks and Git Flow workflow
- **Git Flow Workflow Integration** with automated code review before merging
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md** with comprehensive AI assistant instructions

## 🌿 Git Flow Workflow

This project follows **Git Flow** branching strategy for organized, scalable development:

### Branch Structure

```
main (production)
  ↑
  └─── release/v1.2.0 ──┐
                        ↓
develop (integration)
  ↑
  ├─── feature/add-widget-sync
  ├─── feature/improve-diff-viewer
  └─── bugfix/fix-sync-error

hotfix/v1.1.1 (from main)
  ↓
  └─→ main + develop
```

### Branch Types

| Branch Type | Naming | Source | Target | Purpose |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **main** | `main` | - | - | Production-ready code |
| **develop** | `develop` | - | - | Integration branch |
| **feature** | `feature/*` | develop | develop | New features |
| **bugfix** | `bugfix/*` | develop | develop | Bug fixes |
| **release** | `release/v*` | develop | main + develop | Release preparation |
| **hotfix** | `hotfix/*` | main | main + develop | Critical production fixes |

### Workflow Rules

1. **Never commit directly to main or develop**
2. **All features go through pull requests**
3. **Code review required before merge**
4. **All tests must pass before merge**
5. **Features merge to develop, not main**
6. **Releases and hotfixes merge to both main and develop**

## 🤖 Subagents

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that Claude Code uses proactively or on-demand. They're located in `.claude/agents/`.

## 📋 Workflow Examples

### Git Flow Feature Development (Complete Workflow)

**Starting a new feature**:
```bash
# 1. Start feature branch from develop
/feature-start add-widget-sync

# This automatically:
# - Switches to develop
# - Pulls latest changes
# - Creates feature/add-widget-sync branch
# - Provides development guidance
```

**During development**:
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Review as you go
/review

# 3. Run tests
/run-tests all

# 4. Check types
/check-types

# 5. Commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Add widget sync functionality"

# 6. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/add-widget-sync
```

**Finishing the feature**:
```bash
# 1. Finish feature (auto-review and prepare for merge)
/feature-finish

# This automatically:
# - Verifies you're on feature/* branch
# - Checks all changes committed
# - Rebases on latest develop
# - Runs pr-reviewer subagent
# - Provides PR creation instructions

# 2. Create PR to develop (as instructed)
gh pr create --base develop --head feature/add-widget-sync

# 3. Wait for team review and approval

# 4. Merge PR when approved

# 5. Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/add-widget-sync
```

### Hotfix Workflow (Production Emergency)

**When production is broken**:
```bash
# 1. Start hotfix from main
/hotfix-start critical-sync-fix

# You'll be asked to confirm it's truly critical

# 2. Fix the issue (minimal changes only!)

# 3. Test thoroughly
/run-tests all
/check-types

# 4. Review changes
/review

# 5. Finish hotfix
/hotfix-finish

# This creates TWO PRs:
# - hotfix/critical-sync-fix → main (production)
# - hotfix/critical-sync-fix → develop (future releases)

# 6. Merge to main first, tag, deploy

# 7. Then merge to develop
```

### Release Workflow

**Preparing a release**:
```bash
# 1. Start release branch from develop
/release-start v1.2.0

# 2. Update version numbers
# - Update package.json
# - Update backend version
# - Update CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Final testing
/run-tests all
/check-types

# 4. Fix any last-minute bugs (NO NEW FEATURES!)

# 5. Finish release
/release-finish

# This merges to BOTH:
# - main (production)
# - develop (bring changes back)

# 6. Tag the release on main
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# 7. Deploy to production
```

### Daily Development Workflow

**Starting your day**:
```bash
# 1. Start development servers
./start-dev.sh

# 2. Pull latest develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 3. Check current type safety
/check-types

# 4. Start working on feature
/feature-start my-new-feature
```

**Before committing**:
```bash
# 1. Review your changes
/review

# 2. Run tests
/run-tests all

# 3. If all looks good, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 4. Push regularly
git push
```

### Debugging Workflow

**When API connection fails**:
```bash
# 1. Debug the specific instance
/debug-api 1

# 2. Test the connection
/test-api 1

# 3. Follow the recommendations provided
```

**When sync operation seems risky**:
```bash
# 1. Validate the sync
/check-sync

# 2. Review the risk assessment
# 3. Make adjustments if needed
```

### Testing Workflow

**Adding tests for new code**:
```bash
# 1. Generate tests
/add-test backend/services/new_service.py

# 2. Review generated tests
# 3. Run tests to verify
/run-tests backend
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When to Use Subagents

**Proactive Use** (Automatic):
- `frontend-reviewer` and `backend-reviewer` activate automatically during code reviews
- `magento-api-debugger` activates when API errors occur
- `sync-validator` activates before sync execution

**Manual Use** (Explicit request):
- "Use the test-generator to create tests for X"
- "Use the sync-validator to check this operation"
- "Use the magento-api-debugger to diagnose this error"

### When to Use Slash Commands

**Use slash commands for**:
- Quick, repetitive tasks
- Standard development workflows
- Testing and validation
- Debugging common issues

**Don't use slash commands for**:
- Complex, multi-step operations (let Claude handle these)
- One-off unique tasks
- Exploratory analysis

## 📊 Benefits

### Time Savings
- **Code Review**: Automated review reduces manual review time by ~70%
- **Testing**: Generated tests save ~2-4 hours per feature
- **Debugging**: Structured debugging process reduces issue resolution time by ~50%

### Quality Improvements
- **Consistency**: Automated reviews ensure consistent code quality
- **Test Coverage**: Test generator ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Best Practices**: Reviewers enforce project standards

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation**: Subagents encode team knowledge
- **Onboarding**: New developers can learn patterns from reviews
- **Standards**: Consistent feedback reinforces best practices
